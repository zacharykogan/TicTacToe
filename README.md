RULES:

The goal of the game is to get three in a row, horizontal, vertical or diagonal. You play on a three by three game board. The first move is X and the second is O. Place Xs and Os on the game board until one has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, it is a tie.

Enjoy!
